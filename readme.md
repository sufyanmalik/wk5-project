Reflection

What I didnt complete:

I wasnt able to implement a like function and I thought about how it would be cool to add an author option to each post. Also the option for only the author to delete their joke but not entirely sure how that would work.

Issues I had:

- new jokes were being displayed twice when added on the client page so had to go through code a lot of times to try and figure out why this was happening, which I think because I was calling fetchJokes twice
- getting supbase linked to the env file correctly, this took a while to get right.

Things I'm still unsure of:

- i added my env details when deploying on render - I think this was the correct thing to do?
